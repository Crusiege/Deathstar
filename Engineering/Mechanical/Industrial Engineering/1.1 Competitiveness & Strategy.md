## Industrial Engineering

<p>The design or improvement of system of people, machines,
information, and money to achieve some goal with efficiency,
quality, and safety.</p>


## Industrial Engineering focuses on
1. ### Quality
<p>How can we make sure that the system is consistently producing goods and services that meet customer needs?</p>
2. ### Safety
<p>How can we keep people from
making mistakes? How can we
protect people from hazards in
the work place?</p>

## Definition of IE
The American Institute of Industrial Engineers (AIIE) defines Industrial
Engineering as follows:<br>

==*“Industrial Engineering is concerned with the design, improvement and installation of integrated systems of men, materials and equipment. It draws upon specialized knowledge and skills in the mathematical, social, and physical sciences together with the principles and methods of engineering analysis and design to specify, predict and evaluate the results to be obtained from such systems.”*==

## Industrial Revolutions
1. ### Industry 1.0
- **Period:** Late 18th to early 19th century (began in England around 1760).
- **Key Features:** Transition from manual labor and handicrafts to mechanized manufacturing powered by steam engines.
- **Major Innovations:** Spinning jenny, power loom, steam engine.
- **Impact:** Transformed textile, mining, and glass industries. Enabled mass production, reduced costs and increased productivity, but also led to poor working conditions and the rise of factories
2. ### Industry 2.0
- **Period:** Late 19th to early 20th century.
- **Key Features:** Introduction of assembly lines, mass production, and use of electricity in factories.
- **Major Innovations:** Assembly line (Henry Ford), light bulb, telephone, internal combustion engine.
- **Impact:** Dramatic increase in production capacity and efficiency. Products became more affordable, and industries such as steel, chemical, and automotive flourished. Marked increase in urbanization and changes in society, including the rise of the middle class and urban working population
2. ### Industry 3.0
- **Period:** Late 20th century.
- **Key Features:** Introduction of computers, automation, and electronics into manufacturing (digital revolution).
- **Major Innovations:** Programmable logic controllers (PLCs), personal computers, robotics, internet.
- **Impact:** Automation reduced the need for manual labor, increased production speed and precision, enabled mass customization, and fostered the development of new industries (e.g., digital entertainment, social media, e-commerce). Led to significant economic and labor market shifts
4. ### Industry 4.0
- **Period:** Early 21st century to present.
- **Key Features:** Integration of cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing in manufacturing (“smart factories”).
- **Major Innovations:** Sensors and smart devices, big data analytics, real-time data exchange, advanced robotics, additive manufacturing (3D printing).
- **Impact:** Automation and connectivity enabled real-time decision-making, predictive maintenance, higher efficiency, flexible mass production, and improved customization. Industries benefit from increased data transparency and new business models
5. ### Industry 5.0
- **Period:** Emerging (2020s onwards).
- **Key Features:** Collaboration between humans and intelligent machines for human-centric, sustainable, and resilient manufacturing.
- **Major Innovations:** Advanced AI, collaborative robots (“cobots”), further personalization, sustainable production, focus on worker well-being and environmental responsibility.
- **Impact:** Emphasizes collaboration, ethics, and sustainability. Seeks to balance technological advancements with social and environmental goals (e.g., climate neutrality, circular economy)
## Competitiveness
Companies must be competitive to sell their goods and services in the marketplace. Competitiveness is an important factor in determining whether a company prospers, barely gets by, or fails.
### Ways companies compete with each other
1. #### Marketing
- Identifying consumer wants and needs
- Pricing
- Advertising and promotion
2. #### Operations
- Product and service design
- Cost
- Location
- Quality
- Quick response
- Flexibility
- Inventory management
- Supply chain management
- Service
## Strategy
High-level plan and direction that guides an organization in optimizing its operations, improving efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing productivity while aligning with long-term business goals and market demands. It involves setting clear objectives, choosing competitive approaches such as cost leadership or differentiation, and applying industrial engineering methods like process improvement, automation, and lean manufacturing to translate strategic goals into practical actions. Effective industrial engineering strategy also prioritizes adaptability to new technologies and sustainability, ensuring continuous improvement and competitive advantage in dynamic environments.
## Why some Organizations Fail?
- Too much emphasis on product and service design and not enough on improvement.
- Neglecting investments in capital and human resources.
- Failing to establish good internal communications.
- Failing to consider customer wants and needs.
## Operations Strategy
- **Strategies:** Plans for achieving organizational goals.
- **Mission:** The reason for the existence of an organization.
- **Mission Statement:** Answers the question “What business are we in?"
- **Goals:** Provide details and scope of the mission.
- **Tactics:** The methods and actions taken to accomplish strategies.
